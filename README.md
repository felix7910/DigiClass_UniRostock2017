# Introduction to Digital Classics / Einf√ºhrung in die "Digital Classics"

Block Seminar at the University of Rostock (course no. [74086](https://studip.uni-rostock.de/dispatch.php/course/details/index/111358225f25f791f8cce36960af243f))

## Description

This intensive seminar (Blockseminar, 2 SWS) offers an introduction to Digital Classics for philology students, and does not require any prior technical knowledge, but just a basic level of digital literacy.

Students will first gain some historical knowledge about Digital Humanities as a discipline, and of Digital Classics as a research area and community of practice. Then, they will be introduced to various digital methods, tools and technologies that can be applied to the core activities of classical philologists (i.e. reading, writing/publishing, collating, editing, translating, annotating).

During the practical sessions (accounting for approx. 30% of the course time) students will get to know the tools available to carry out each of these core activities in a digital environment, as well as the underlying standards and technologies. By doing so, they will develop a solid understanding of the problems related to the digital representation of philological data.

(The course is taught mostly in English, while the use of German in the classroom is possible and welcome, especially during the practical session. Structure of the course: frontal lessons (60-70%) + practical sessions (30-40%). A personal laptop is required for the practical sessions.)
